You can collect your order physically from the delivery partner or the security personnel at your hostel, depending on the time of delivery. - **If you collect your order physically yourself by telling the OTP before the hostel gate close timings, there is no refund for that order.** - If your hostel gate is closed and your security at the gate collects and delivers the order for you, and you find any items missing or damaged in your order, you must report the incident to us by email within 25 minutes of the delivery confirmation. Please include your order number, the name and quantity of the missing or damaged items, and a photo of the proof of delivery in your email. - We will review your refund request and notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund within 48 hours. If your refund is approved, we will process it and credit the original amount of your order to your payment method within 7 working days. - We reserve the right to refuse a refund if you fail to comply with the above conditions, or if we find any evidence of fraud, abuse, or misuse of our service. - We may update or change this refund policy from time to time without prior notice.

However, there may be some situations where the delivery partner may face delays or difficulties in reaching your location. Please read this delivery policy carefully to understand your rights and obligations. - When you place your order, you will be asked to select a time slot for your delivery. You can choose any available time slot that suits your convenience. We will try our best to deliver your order within the selected time slot, but we cannot guarantee the exact delivery time due to factors beyond our control, such as traffic, weather, road conditions, etc. - The delivery partner will contact you by phone when they arrive at your hostel gate. You are expected to respond to their call and collect your order physically by telling the OTP verification code within 10 minutes of their arrival. If you fail to do so, the delivery partner will leave your order with the security personnel at your hostel gate, if possible, or take your order back to the restaurant, depending on the situation. - If your order is taken back to the warehouse, you will be notified by email or phone. You can either request a rescheduling of your delivery for the next available time slot or cancel your order and receive a refund for the order amount, excluding the delivery charge. The delivery charge is non-refundable in this case, as the delivery partner has already attempted to deliver your order once. - If your order is left with the security personnel at your hostel gate, you are responsible for collecting your order from them as soon as possible. We are not liable for any loss, damage, or deterioration of your order after it is left with the security personnel. You are also not eligible for a refund in this case, as the delivery partner has already delivered your order to your hostel gate. - We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we find any evidence of fraud, abuse, or misuse of our service.

However, the actual delivery time may vary depending on various factors, such as the availability of the items, the distance of the restaurant, the traffic conditions, the weather conditions, the number of orders, etc. Therefore, any delivery time claims that we make in our advertisements, promotions, or communications are not guarantees, but estimates based on our best efforts. 🙏 - When you place your order, you will be asked to select a time slot for your delivery. You can choose any available time slot that suits your convenience. We will try our best to deliver your order within the selected time slot, but we cannot guarantee the exact delivery time due to factors beyond our control. - If we claim to deliver your order under a certain time, such as 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or 60 minutes, in any of our advertisements, promotions, or communications, it is an estimate based on our average delivery time for similar orders in similar locations. You are advised to review our advertisements, promotions, and communications periodically for any changes. Your continued use of our service after any changes to our delivery time claims will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you have any questions or feedback about this delivery time claims policy, please contact us at refunds.aun@gmail.com. We are always happy to hear from you.</b></p>
